# Reddit-Bot(In progress)
Reddit bot searches reddit for user specified keywords on user specified subreddits using the PRAW library.

The client_id, client_secret are provided by Reddit on creating a developer account and user_agent is an unique name used in-case the bot starts to malfunction.
Currently, my project returns the top posts (the number of posts displayed is entered by the user) in the "Hot" section of an user defined subreddit.
As the project progresses, you will be able to search the keyword.
